Gitea Helm Chart for Validated Patterns

This is a small fork to make sure that gitea runs on openshift, that it uses the more simple non-ha postgresql
backend and that a route is exposed by default

The reason for forking it and not having a full subchart + override in top-level values.yaml is the number
of bugs helm has when trying to remove subkeys from subcharts (or in the case of gitea as a subchart: subsubcharts).
Or general issues with subcharts.

By doing this we do not need to patch values files in subcharts and dependencies of subcharts
